# DSCI 554 Assignment 2

In this assignment we will create bubble charts manually in svg and dynamically using javascript. We will also use javascript charting libraries to realize line and multi-line charts.

## Description

Using UN Data of your choice for the same 10 countries of `a1` create the charts listed below. For the charts you implement, separate your code in css and js files and use it in the index.html, e.g., `chart1.css`, `chart1.js`. Use sound development techniques: develop one feature at the time, test and commit often.

In `index.html`:

1. Explain the datasets provenance (what it is and where it is coming from)
2. In [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org) create a __bubble cloud chart__ (make sure to use __pixels coordinates__)
3. Add the bubble could chart you made in Inkscape as an image using the `<img>` tag
4. Implement using SVG `circle` and `text` elements the bubble cloud chart you created in Inkscape
5. Implement using the code provided in the lab the bubble cloud chart you created in Inkscape
6. Implement using the code provided in the lab a D3 line chart for one country
7. Implement a multi-line chart using Vega-Lite
8. Implement a multi-line chart created with a JS library of your choice that we have not used so far (e.g., Plotly, Highcharts)
9. In `QUIZ_QUESTIONS.md` add 3 or more questions, one question on the slides, one on the lab and one on the required reading.

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for the lab and quiz questions.__

|               | Presentation  | Inkscape SVG | Charts |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Sophisticated | Page is well presented and charts are well formatted (4-5 pts)| Design is well thought showing relations and quantities (4-5 pts)| Code is cleanly written and working, bubble charts are according to design, other charts are present and are well formatted (4-5 pts each) |
| Competent     | Page is not well presented and/or charts are not well formatted (2-3 pts) | Design is not well thought and/or not showing relations and quantities (2-3 pts)| Code not cleanly written and/or working, bubble charts are not according to design, other charts are not all present or are not well formatted (2-3 pts each)|
| Needs work    | Page is not presented correctly and charts are not formatted (0-1 pts)| Design is not thought and not showing relations and quantities (0-1 pts)| Code is not cleanly written and not working, bubble charts are not according to design, other charts are not present and/or not are well formatted (0-1 pts each)|
