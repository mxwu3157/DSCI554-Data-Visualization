- You must demonstrate good development practices by making at least 2 incremental commits per visualization

## Rubric

__15% of the grade is for the lab and quiz questions.__

|               | Table  | Charts | Inkscape design | Development/Page |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Sophisticated | Table is well formatted and presented and meets all the requirements (4-5 pts) | Charts is well implemented according to design and meet all the requirements (4-5 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are well designed. (4-5 pts *per chart*) | Using good development practices, the page is well formatted, the data is well described (4-5 pts) |
| Competent     | Table is not well formatted and presented and does not meet well all the requirements (2-3 pts) | Chart is not well implemented according to design or do not meet all the requirements (2-3 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are not well designed. (2-3 pts *per chart*) | Not using good development practices well, the page is not well formatted, the data is not well described (2-3 pts) |
| Needs work    | Table is not formatted and presented and does not meet the requirements (0-1 pts) | Chart is not implemented according to design and do not meet the requirements (0-1 pts *per chart*) | Minimalist charts are missing or are not designed. (0-1 pts *per chart*) | Not using good development practices, the page is not formatted, the data is not described (0-1 pts) |

## Homework Guidelines

- Homework repository must be updated before the deadline
- Commits after the deadline will not be considered unless requested
- Late policy: 10% of total available points per each late day; duration less than 24 hours counts as one whole day
- Homework is expected to work in CHROME

## Important Note from Graders

__Ensure that you use the same case when referring to files than the actual filename__ as the homework may be assessed on Linux systems. For example, if an image tag refers to `myFile.png` but the actual filename is `myfile.png`, the image will not appear on the web page in Linux systems. We will deduct points if this happens. Use [Visual Studio Code HTML path completion feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#_html-path-completion) and/or double-check filenames to avoid this problem.
