The lab contains R notebooks (`.Rmd` files) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks (`.ipynb` files).

Use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) to open `assignment.Rproj` (RStudio project file). You can start RStudio in the current folder from the command line with:

```bash
open -a RStudio assignment.Rproj
```

Use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/)  to run the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files). You can start JupyterLab in the current folder from the command line with:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

## Working with Notebooks

### ðŸš€ Getting Started with RStudio

See [Take a tour of RStudioâ€™s IDE](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). See also [RStudio Cloud Guide](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide) for the online version of RStudio.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started with JupyterLab

Read [JupyterLab Documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) to get started.

- JupiterLab notebooks are made of two basic types of cells:
  - `CODE`: code  cells
  - `TEXT`: markdown cells
- Insert new cells: Using the Dropdown in the above toolbar
- Keyboard Shortcuts: see under `Run` menu

See also [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an online version of JupyterLab.

A good starting point is the [Welcome To Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
